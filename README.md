# PSoup

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of PSoup is to enable users to quickly generate mathematical
descriptions of complex systems, which can be used to run simulations.
PSoup reads diagrammatic representations of biological systems
(specifically of type SBGN), and uses algebraic rules to transform the
diagram into a set of difference equations. PSoup provides support to
enable the running of simulations, as well as analysing the resulting
output.

To build a diagram of type SBGN, go to [Newt Pathway Viewer &
Editor](https://newteditor.org/).

To see a series of tutorials on how to use PSoup, go to .

## Installation
