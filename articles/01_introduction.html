</h3>
<p>The PSoup package was built as a tool to support the generation of
network descriptions of biological systems. It is embedded in a larger
workflow designed to ultimately assist in predicting the direction of
change in a system in response to perturbations.</p>
<p>This workflow consists of several critical aspects:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Describe the prior knowledge of the system as a series of
statements.</li>
<li>Record the starting conditions and outcomes of experiments.</li>
<li>Translate the prior knowledge statements into a diagram.</li>
<li>Convert the diagram into a computational model.</li>
<li>Test if the computational model recapitulates experimental
outcomes.</li>
<li>Design new experiments to test the predictive power of the
model.</li>
</ol>
<p>PSoup has been designed to automate aspects 3, 4, and 5. Therefore,
when generating models of a biological system, the user only needs to be
actively involved with collating the existing knowledge of the system,
and describing said system using a standard diagram syntax. Once a
diagram has been produced, PSoup will convert that diagram into a
mathematical model using a set of algebraic rules. This mathematical
model can then be used to simulate how the system deviates from the
baseline under different conditions.</p>
<p>A benefit of PSoup is that it allows users who may not be comfortable
with mathematics to dabble with simulations. Even so, PSoup is
completely transparent in regard to how the diagrammatic description of
the system has been translated into a series of equations. It does this
by generating an R script which defines a function (called
<code>nextStep</code>) which calculates the values of nodes for each
simulation step. By allowing access to this function, PSoup gives the
possibility for the user to manually change aspects of the mathematical
description of the system if they wish to do so. However, given the
philosophy behind PSoup’s construction, such modification is not
actively encouraged.</p>
<p>A consequence of the topological approach taken by PSoup, is that
this style of modelling is qualitative as opposed to quantitative. It is
concerned with predicting the direction of change rather than the exact
amount of change. To do this, the values of nodes are normalised such
that they are expressed in relation to some system baseline (often the
wild type when describing biological systems), which is defined as 1.
Simulations are run until the system reaches stability, at which point
the node of interest can be checked for its new value. Given that there
are no coefficients used in this style of modelling, the through time
information for the simulations are not biologically meaningful. The
only information of interest is the value of nodes at steady state.</p>
