<h4 id="model-language-nodes-and-edges">Model language: Nodes and Edges<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-language-nodes-and-edges"></a>
</h4>
<p>Nodes and edges represent our beliefs regarding how plants integrate
information to make decisions. Nodes represent a kind of information
used by the plant to make developmental decisions. This can include
internal hormones, or externally sourced inputs such as light, or
nitrogen. Each node type will be expressed as a value relative to some
baseline 1. Often, this baseline will represent the wild-type of a plant
under ideal environmental conditions.</p>
<p>Edges represent the directionality of influence, as well as the
influence type between nodes. Edges describe how the plant uses the
information contained in nodes to make decisions.</p>
<p>Nodes will be represented by nouns as they represent something that
the plant can use as a signal. Edges will be represented by verbs as
they describe the influence of a node on downstream nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="model-language-modifiers">Model language: Modifiers<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-language-modifiers"></a>
</h4>
<p>Modifiers act to scale the value of specific nodes in the network.
They can represent critical genetic instructions that are necessary for
the functioning of their specific node. Modifiers are given a value by
the user and act by describing the level of expression of a node
relative to baseline (1). The value of the modifier will be multiplied
against the value of the node as determined by any other system inputs.
Therefore, a modifier value of 0 will have the function of removing the
node from the network irrespective of the other inputs being received by
said node.</p>
<p>In the context of the model, modifiers behave as parameters which
define the conditions under which a simulation is occurring. They can be
considered the inputs of the model. The values of modifiers remain
static over the course of the simulation. In contrast, nodes behave as
variables. The values of nodes are expected to change over the course of
the simulation. Once the simulation reaches a stable state (node values
are unchanging), the values of nodes will be taken as the output of the
simulation. The network topology in this case is the model being
tested.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="model-language-compartments">Model language: Compartments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#model-language-compartments"></a>
</h4>
<p>Compartments are useful in that they can help define locations of
influence in the network. They have very little influence on the
progression of a simulation as they do not change the behaviour of
either nodes or edges. However, they are useful when there are multiple
sources of production for a node, and for allowing the differential
expression of modifiers within different locations of the system. For
example, the hormone Strigolactone is produced in both the root and
shoot of the plant. By creating root and shoot compartments, a
Strigolactone node can be defined in both the compartments without
otherwise being distinguished from each other. PSoup will automatically
treat the two nodes as separate entities while maintaining clarity for
the user. Compartments also facilitate the case when modifiers are
differentially expressed in different locations of a biological system.
If a modifier is attached to nodes in different compartments, the user
will be able to specify different values for each compartment. This is
useful, for example, in the case that the user is trying to replicate
the conditions of a grafting experiment where a gene is knocked out in
one location but not in the other.</p>

<h4 id="sbgn-terminology">SBGN terminology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sbgn-terminology"></a>
</h4>
<p>SBGN is a set of standardised graphical languages used to describe
biological systems. The description of hypotheses has been restricted to
the use of terminology that maps directly onto the SBGN Activity Flow
language.</p>
<p>There are many different mechanisms by which a biological system
regulates itself. However, here the focus must be limited to whether the
influence between nodes is either positive or negative in terms of the
outcome of the downstream node.</p>

</h3>
<p>Hypotheses (MOH), and the Edge Oriented Hypotheses (EOH). In either
case, the modifier or edge will be contextualised by nodes. In the MOH,
a modifier is being attached to a node which will allow the modifier to
weight the strength of action of the node. A MOH will always be found in
the following form:</p>
<center>
The &lt;modifier&gt; modifier is necessary to produce &lt;node&gt;.
</center>
<p>Modifiers must always be indicated as modifiers, otherwise they can
be assumed to be nodes. The same modifier can be attached to multiple
nodes. MOHs will never contain edge information.</p>
<p>EOHs express the direction and type of influence between nodes and
will never contain modifier information. They will always take the
following form:</p>
<center>
&lt;origin node&gt; &lt;edge type&gt; &lt;destination node&gt;.
</center>
<p>The EOH has some additional flexibility built in as they can make use
of logical operators. Combinations of nodes can be specified by making
use of the AND operator as a separator to list all the relevant nodes.
If you use the AND operator, you are indicating that all the specified
nodes must be present for an action to occur.</p>
<p>Compartmentalising nodes in the network can be good for two reasons.
The first is to visually assist in understanding where different loci of
influence exist in the system. The second is to allow for the
possibility of differential expression of modifiers in the case that the
same modulator has been assigned to nodes existing in different
compartments. This is useful when modelling plant development under
different grafting conditions. Grafting involves attaching the rootstock
of one plant, to the scion (shoot) of another plant. This allows for the
differential expression of the same gene within different locations in a
plant. Compartmental information can be provided by adding â€˜in the
&lt;location&gt;â€™ to the end of either the MOH or EOH. Example
statements can be seen in Table 4.</p>
<p>Below is a list of considerations that should be kept in mind when
constructing hypotheses and diagrams:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each interaction should be represented only once.</li>
<li>Nodes must share an edge with at least one other node.</li>
<li>Each interaction that will be included in the model/diagram should
be included in the list of hypotheses.</li>
<li>Interactions should be specified only between neighbouring nodes (no
summary interactions should be stated, overall effects should be deduced
from the combination of intermediary interactions).
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Any summarising statements are likely to be mistakenly interpreted
as an alternate route of action.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Independent inputs should be distinguished from non-independent
inputs. Non-independent inputs can be indicated using the word AND to
list all the interacting inputs.</li>
<li>Modifiers should be distinguished from nodes.</li>
<li>Modifiers should be connected to all the nodes on which they act (a
single modifier can be attached to multiple nodes).
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If a â€˜modifierâ€™ itself has inputs in the system (e.g.Â if the
expression of a modifier can itself be regulated by other nodes), that
â€˜modifierâ€™ should be expressed as a node with an attached modifier. The
node and attached modifier can be given the same name to communicate
what you are doing. This node will have a necessarily stimulatory
relationship with all nodes for which said modifier is essential. This
is useful in instances where the expression of a gene is regulated by
the network.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Statements should be simplified as much as possible to the effect of
whether levels of the influenced node are expected to go up or down (are
stimulatory or inhibitory).</li>
<li>It might be necessary to infer an â€˜integratorâ€™ or â€˜intermediateâ€™
node to correctly represent what is going on. This decision can be left
to the modeller, who will choose the best representation given the
context of the full network (this of course should be confirmed later
with the biologist).
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>A consequence of the modeller deciding that there needs to be an
intermediary node, will be the creation of a new statement describing a
stimulatory relationship between the originating and intermediary
node.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If there are multiple sources for the contents of a node, they
should be distinguished from each other by placing the different
representations of the node in different compartments.</li>
<li>There must not be any nodes existing outside of a compartment.</li>
<li>A record of supporting evidence behind each node should be kept for
reference. This will help restrain the network to highly supported
interactions (at least initially). In addition, it will make it easier
to interrogate the network in the case that the model is not validated
against biological data.</li>
