\title{A function that creates a string with coregulators multiplied together}
\usage{
coregulators(coreg, returnNum = FALSE, language)
}
\arguments{
\item{coreg}{a subsed of a the inputs of a hormone object. This subset
must all have the same modulating effect, and have coregulators}

\item{returnNum}{return the number of unique coregulator sets. Default is
set to FLASE.}

\item{language}{which programming language should the equation be generated in?
Can be either "R", or "C".}

\description{
Coregulators are sorted so that their multiplications are only represented
once. Each modulator is given a temporal modifier. Sets of coregulators are
summed.
