### Purpose and design philosophy for peaSoup

### Walkthrough of how to use peaSoup

This is a short tutorial to demonstrate how you can use peaSoup to simulate network outcomes. Examples will use data that is included in this package.

First start by building a diagram of your network using some editor that can support SBGN diagrams of the Activity Flow language (I recommend [Newt Pathway Viewer & Editor](https://web.newteditor.org/)). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.cap="Figure 1. An example of a network diagram that can be produced using Newt."}
knitr::include_graphics("DunAFgenotype.jpg")
```

Once you are happy with your diagram, click `File` -> `Export` -> `SBGN-ML Plain`. This will generate a text file representation of your diagram using SBGN markdown language. You will need to use the 'convertSBGNdiagram' function to translate this text file into Network object that is easy to use.

```{r}
library(peaSoup)
convertSBGNdiagram("../data-raw/DunAFgenotype.sbgn", "PeaNetwork")
```

This Network object can then be used to generate a function called 'buildModel' which contains a series of difference equations 


### Algebraic Rules 


Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format:

- Never uses retina figures
- Has a smaller default figure size
- Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style

## Vignette Info

Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette.

## Styles

The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows:

    output: 
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        css: mystyles.css

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```

You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML:

    output:
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        fig_caption: yes

Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**.

## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```
